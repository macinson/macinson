## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maciek - an ambitious, hard-working, and open-minded student with a particular interest in programming, as well
as its applications in business and entertainment. Apart from my academic activities, I enjoy learning various
programming languages and applying them in a creative manner. I always strive to achieve the best result in
everything I do and to gain as much knowledge as possible.

I love creating random stuff that just works (serving a purpose is optional).
